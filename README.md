# Cybersecurity Monitoring & Transaction Fraud Detection Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **cybersecurity and fraud detection dashboard** built using **Streamlit**. It allows users to monitor transaction fraud risk and network anomalies interactively. The dashboard integrates pre-trained machine learning models to provide:

- Transaction fraud prediction using a **Random Forest classifier**.
- Network anomaly detection using **Isolation Forest** and **Autoencoder** models.
- Interactive visualizations for fraud probability, risk levels, anomaly scores, and protocol counts.

The interface is designed with a professional layout, color-coded metrics, and **Plotly visualizations** for easy interpretation of results.

## Features
- **Transaction Dashboard**: Predicts fraud risk and probability for input transaction features.
- **Network Dashboard**: Detects network anomalies and displays anomaly scores and protocol counts.
- **Interactive visualizations**: Gauge charts and bar charts for better insight.
- **User-friendly interface**: Streamlined input forms, color-coded results, and responsive layout.
